\# LangGraph Learning Journey  

\*A Structured Collection of Practical Notebooks — From Fundamentals to Advanced Agentic Patterns\*



---



\### Overview

This repository is a \*\*curated, ordered collection of Jupyter notebooks\*\* created while learning \*\*LangGraph\*\* — an advanced framework for building agentic systems and control flows around language models.  



The notebooks progress \*\*from basic graph concepts\*\* to \*\*intermediate agent design\*\* and culminate in \*\*advanced agentic patterns\*\* such as planning, routing, reflection, and multi-agent collaboration.

\### Learning Goals

By following this notebook series, you will learn to:

\- Understand the \*\*core concepts of LangGraph\*\* — nodes, edges, states, and messages.  

\- Build \*\*memory-aware agents\*\* capable of reasoning over context.  

\- Apply \*\*controllability tools\*\* (breakpoints, time-travel, subgraphs).  

\- Design \*\*advanced agentic behaviors\*\* using patterns such as reflection, routing, planning, and collaboration.  

\- Construct \*\*multi-agent systems\*\* with context isolation and shared memory.  



---



\### Structure \& Progression

Each notebook builds on the previous one, gradually introducing new capabilities:

\- \*\*Basic (1–4)\*\* → Foundations of LangGraph and simple agents  

\- \*\*Intermediate (5–11)\*\* → Adding memory, control, and real-world use cases  

\- \*\*Advanced (12–15.7)\*\* → Patterns for scalable, multi-agent design  



---



\### Prerequisites

\- Python 3.10+  

\- Installed packages: `langgraph`, `langchain-core`, `openai` or equivalent LLM backend, `python-dotenv`

\- Jupyter / VS Code Notebook environment  

\- Use any python package management tool like conda, poetry or uv

\### 💡 Tip

Use this collection as a \*\*hands-on learning roadmap\*\* — run each notebook sequentially to see LangGraph’s full power evolve from simple graphs to autonomous, context-driven agents.
