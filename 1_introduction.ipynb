      "Okay, so I need to figure out what the capital of India is. Let me start by recalling what I know. I know that countries have capitals, which are usually their main cities where the government is based. For example, the capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and the capital of France is Paris. But what about India?\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that India is a large country in South Asia. I think the capital might be New Delhi. Wait, but sometimes people confuse New Delhi with Delhi. Are they the same or different? I think Delhi is a city, and New Delhi is a part of it. Let me think. New Delhi was built by the British in the early 20th century as the capital when they moved from Calcutta (now Kolkata). So maybe New Delhi became the capital in the early 1900s. Then, after India gained independence in 1947, they kept New Delhi as the capital. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I should verify this. Sometimes there can be confusion between the city and the district. The capital of India is New Delhi, which is located within the National Capital Territory of Delhi. So Delhi is a union territory that includes New Delhi as the capital city. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I should check if there's any other city that's sometimes mistaken as the capital. For example, Mumbai is a major city in India and the financial capital, but the political capital is New Delhi. So the answer should be New Delhi. Let me make sure there's no other city. I don't think so. The government of India is based in New Delhi, which is why it's the capital. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the final answer is New Delhi. I should also mention that it's in the National Capital Territory of Delhi to be precise. That way, it's clear that it's not just a city but part of a larger administrative area.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, the first result from DataCamp's tutorial says LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem. It helps define, coordinate, and execute multiple LLM agents or chains. It manages data flow and operations, allowing developers to focus on high-level logic. They mention it's useful for chatbots or multi-agent systems, and there's a LangGraph Studio for visual development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second result from GeeksforGeeks is shorter. It states that LangGraph is an open-source framework by LangChain for creating and managing AI agent workflows. That's a concise definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third result from K21Academy mentions that LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems. It's more low-level and controllable compared to LangChain agents. The content seems cut off, but the main point is about orchestration and control.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should combine these into a coherent summary. Start by stating LangGraph is part of LangChain, its purpose in managing LLM agents, the benefits like structured framework and state management. Mention the visual environment (LangGraph Studio) from the first result. Also include that it's open-source and used for AI agent workflows. Highlight it's more low-level and controllable than other LangChain agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check for any unique points. The DataCamp result also talks about simplifying complex applications and handling various user requests. Need to make sure all key aspects are covered without redundancy. Avoid technical jargon if possible, but since the user is asking for a summary of the search results, some terms like LLM agents are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure the summary is clear, concise, and covers all three sources. Maybe structure it into a few sentences, starting with the definition, then key features, and additional info like Studio and open-source nature.\n",
