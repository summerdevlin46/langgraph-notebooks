      "India is a country in South Asia. The capital is New Delhi, which is a part of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. I think Delhi was the capital before, but then they built New Delhi as the new capital. When was that? Maybe during the British colonial period? The British moved the capital from Kolkata to Delhi in the early 20th century, and then New Delhi was constructed as the new capital in the 1930s. So the current capital is New Delhi.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention that Delhi is a Union Territory and New Delhi is the actual capital city. Sometimes people might refer to Delhi as the capital, but technically it's New Delhi. I need to clarify that to avoid confusion. Also, maybe mention that New Delhi is home to the government buildings, such as the Parliament House and the Rashtrapati Bhavan. That adds context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, are there any common misconceptions here? Some might think Mumbai is the capital because it's a major city and the financial hub. But no, Mumbai is the capital of Maharashtra state. The national capital is definitely New Delhi. Let me double-check a reliable source. Yes, according to official government sources and geography references, New Delhi is the capital of India. So the answer should be straightforward but include the distinction between Delhi and New Delhi to be accurate.\n",

The capital was shifted from Kolkata (Calcutta) to Delhi to reflect the growing political and administrative importance of northern India.\n",

LangGraph, created by [LangChain](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langchain), is an open source AI agent framework designed to build, deploy and manage complex generative AI agent workflows. At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an [AI agent workflow](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents). LangGraph is also built on several key technologies, including [LangChain,](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langchain) a Python framework for building AI applications. By combining these technologies with a set of APIs and tools, LangGraph provides users with a versatile platform for developing AI solutions and workflows including [chatbots](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatbots), state graphs and [other agent-based systems](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multiagent-system).',\n",

      "Okay, so the user wants a summary of the search results about LangGraph. Let me start by looking at each of the provided results.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the GeeksforGeeks link says LangGraph is an open-source framework by LangChain for AI agent workflows. That's straightforward. The DataCamp tutorial adds more details: it's part of LangChain's ecosystem, helps coordinate multiple LLM agents or chains, manages data flow and operations, and has a visual tool called LangGraph Studio. The IBM page mentions it's built by LangChain, uses graph-based architectures, and is for complex generative AI workflows. They also note it's open source and built on Python with LangChain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to combine these points. The core idea is that LangGraph is a framework from LangChain for managing AI agents. It's open-source, uses graphs to model workflows, and helps with coordination and execution. The IBM page also lists use cases like chatbots, state graphs, and multi-agent systems. The DataCamp part emphasizes the visual development environment, which is a plus for developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should mention the key features: open-source, part of LangChain, graph-based, coordinates LLM agents, simplifies complex workflows. Also, include the tools like LangGraph Studio. The IBM link adds that it's built on Python and LangChain, and has various use cases in different industries. Need to make sure the summary is concise but covers all the main points without getting too technical. Avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Let me check if all the sources agree on the main points. Yes, they all confirm it's by LangChain, open-source, for managing AI workflows. The IBM page has more use cases, so including those would add value. Alright, time to put it all together clearly.\n",
